# Auctioncore Auction
The Remilia Corporation has announced a forthcoming retroactive airdrop for 'Auctioncore' NFTs. The <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/bidder">Bonkle Bidder</a> will very likely place more bids than any other bidder and as such receive a significant number of Auctioncore NFTs. These NFTs will themselves be auctioned off in a random order. Profits received will be sent to the <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/treasury">Bonkle Treasury</a>. If the Auctioncore airdrop occurs immediately following or before the Bonkler mint-out, all Bonkle-protocol accumulated Auctioncore will be auctioned between the <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/re-auction">forced auctioning</a> of the <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/reserve">Bonkler Reserve</a> Bonklers.
