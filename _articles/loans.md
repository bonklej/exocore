# Bonkle Loans
Owners of Bonklers may deposit their NFT to the Bonkle Loan protocol and receive $BONKLE tokens. Depositors will be required to pay interest on the received $BONKLE to avoid liquidation. Liquidations transfer the loaned $BONKLER to the <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/reserve">Bonkler Reserve</a>. The amount of $BONKLE loaned may not exceed the burn value of the deposited Bonkler. This is to ensure outstanding $BONKLE at time of liquidation does not violate quasi-stability.This provides an opportunity for liquidity amongst Bonklers as traditional NFT pools cannot apply to Bonklers as they resist floor-price-equivalence. Further, this allows for a vehicle to grow the <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/reserve">Bonkler Reserve</a> other than mint auctions.
