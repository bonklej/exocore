# Bonklecore Airdrop
To further incentivize acquisition of $BONKLE tokens via entrance queue - rather than the open market - a retroactive NFT collection known as 'BonkleCore' will be released. There will be one BonkleCore NFT for each Bonkler auction the <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/bidder">Bonkle Bidder</a> participates in. A day's Bonklecore will be awarded semi-randomly amongst the day's depositors according to their proportionate share of the day's deposits as well as their entry bid price. Days where the Bidder not only successfully bids, but wins have a significant positive modifier added to their rarity roll on the generative image.

On the day of the Bonklecore NFT release, the winning wallets will be announced and airdropped (or made claimable).

**Example:**

    Three bidders enter the queue (in this order) with bids of #1: 2Ξ, #2: 3Ξ, and #3: 6Ξ at bids of 0.7$BONKLE to 1Ξ, 0.6:1, and 0.5:1 respectively. The day's bonkler was won for 10Ξ. Therefore the three bidders received 0.7, 1.8, and 3 $BONKLE respectively. Bidders #2 and #3 have 0 ether in the queue while bidder #1 remains with 1Ξ at 0.7$BONKLE:1Ξ.
    The three bidders contributed: #1: 10%, #2: 30%, and #3: 60% of the day's utilized ether. With respect to the Bonklecore lottery, the percentages are thereafter modified by their bid's distance from the average bid ratio of utilized ether. This day's average bid is 0.55 ((0.7x1+ 0.6x3+ 0.5x6)/10). The bidders' weighted contributions are calculated by the following formula: (%-contribution) x (100 - bid's distance from average) #1: 10% x (1.0 - (.7-.55)/.55) = 7.27%, #2: 30% x (1.0 - (.6-.55)/.55) = 27.27%, #3: 60% x (1.0 - (.5-.55/.55)) = 65.45% The sum of these weighted contributions is 1.0.

***Note**: if a depositor has multiple bids, they are each treated as distinct contributions, however they retain a claim to each bid's lottery winnings. Therefore a given depositors odds for the day's Bonkelcore can be thought of as the sum of the odds of each of their bids.*
