# Bonkle Treasury

The Bonkle Treasury accumulates ether via: 
1) <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/entrace-queue">Entrance queue</a> bids above above the $BONKLE floor price
2) Fees from open market trading of $BONKLE
3) Proceeds generated by both successful and unsucessful <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/re-auction">re-auction</a> of <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/reserve">Bonkle Reserve</a> Bonklers
4) Proceeds of <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/auctioncore-auction">AuctionCore Auctions</a>

Ether within the treasury is redeemable by tokenholders at the exchange rate of `(treasury value)/($BONKLE float)`. Redeemed tokens are immediately burned to ensure that the next holder seeking to exit is entitled to an equal (or greater) share of ether.
