# Bonkle Bonds
Auction commemorating the launch of the $BONKLE token. Attracts 'seed capital' to get Bonkle liquidity off the ground. The only source of compensation for the <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/team">Bonkle Team</a> beyond the $BONKLE tokens they may acquire through public means.
- Supply of 181 BonkleBond NFTs
- Each bond entitles its holder to a % claim of <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/treasury">Treasury</a> fees. *Note this is fees only, not the other revenue streams for Bonkle*
- Cumulative percent of <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/treasury">Treasury</a> fees capped at 25%.
- Bonds will be valid for fee collection for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 'Bonkler Months' (30 Bonkler days, AKA 30 Bonkler auctions). There will be an equal number of each duration bond in each category. The single 5% bond will be valid for 3 Bonkler Months.
- Bonds fall into the following categories with corresponding rarities:
  - 0.05%, 100
  - 0.10%, 50
  - 0.50%, 25
  - 1.00%, 5
  - 5.00%, 1
- Each Bond has a corresponding generative image with a rarity proportionate to the percentage times duration (e.g., 0.05% x 1 month = 0.05 'roll' or 0.5% x 3 month = 1.5 'roll'). The single 5% Bond will not be generated, but instead a 1/1 image for the special Bonkle Believer.
- Collection of the Bond's accrued fees is possible only at the end of its duration. I honor of Bonkler, this is done by permanently burning the bond. This enables a secondary bond floor-backed bond market similar to Bonkler itself.
- Bond collection windows all expire on the final auction/burn of the last <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/reserve">Reserve</a> Bonkler (or after the minting of the last Bonkler if the <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/reserve">Reserve</a> is empty at that time). Any Bond yields unclaimed at this time will be transferred to the <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/treasury">Treasury</a> and eligible for redemption by $BONKLE holders.
