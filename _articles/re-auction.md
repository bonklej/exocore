# Re-Auction
On the mint out of the final Bonkler, a timer begins for 7 Bonkler Days (23 hours each). Then, a Bonkler will be chosen at random from the <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/reserve">Bonkler Reserve</a> to be auctioned off. The bidding will start at the burn value of the Bonkler. Bidding will follow rules identical to the original mint auctions of Remilia. If no bids are placed during the 23-hour window, the Bonkler is burned. In either case, the proceeds are transferred to the <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/treasury">Bonkle Treasury</a>.

After the Bonkler re-auction is complete, the next does not begin until the completion of 6 <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/auctioncore-auction">Auctioncore Auctions</a>. If the Bidder has no more Auctioncore to auction, a 23-hour delay takes each of its place.

This yields a usual Bonkle week consisting of 7 auctions: 6 Auctioncore and 1 Bonkler.
