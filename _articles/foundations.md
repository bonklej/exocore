# Theoretical Foundations to the Realization of Bonkle

***Preliminary disclaimer:*** *The following specifications adhere to open source design principles. Bonkle's design rejects sentimental attachment to secrecy in competitive markets. The <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/attacks">attacks section</a> in particular invites assaults on Bonkle from the outset. It is to be assumed assets in Bonkle will be subject to incessant attack. Proper implementation of this specification will ensure the only protection Bonkle requires is secure encryption. If it is not encrypted, let it be known by all. Any who tread upon Bonkle's domain in ignorance of the associated risks do so at their peril.*

Bonkle coheres the impulses of capital accumulation into a platform, a ground for Bonklers to stand upon, looming ever-taller each day. Distributed ledger technology thrust open a fold onto which the Network is migrating.

Bonkle understands Bonkler--like DLT itself--time binds with the force of capital intensities. Bonkle recognizes no Oracle but Bonkler-time. A day is not 24 hours, but 23 and on until the bids are no longer cast. This is law.

Bonkle is ephemeral. As we number our days and years according to the life-granting Sun, Bonkle adheres to Bonkler-time. Snuff out the Sun and the chronology mankind bound to the Earth disappears soon after.

Bonkle will die when Bonkler's life-giving ceases. There will be no excess to capture. There will be no time left.

Bonkle is a magnet attracting capital to Bonkler. Like a well-planned spacecraft bound for distant stars, each encounter with a heavenly body siphons angular momentum. The indifferent solar arrangement carries on all the same after the parasitic blink in its aeonic motion. Yet, for the pilots, the final assist is a time for celebration and gratitude.

Bonkle understands first and foremost what Bonkler saw - a proper siphon requires a greater flow. Bonkler, the first serial auction for reserve-backed NFTs, easily grows in allure beyond that which floating NFTs could achieve. It is only a matter of time before greater and greater capital flows move through Bonkler.

Bonkle understands volume is everything to a siphon. Domain over the pipes of capital flow is prerequisite for the aforementioned accumulation. How best to wield the fruits of this privilege is not for Bonkle to say.

Bonkle is an open castle. Its levies are for all who believe in Bonkle. Bonkle is hyperstitional inasmuch as Bonkle's reality is proportionate to belief in Bonkle. Its floor is its only promise. Acquiring Bonkle in excess of this promise is a declaration of faith in the movement of capital. These bids are cast at one's own risk.
