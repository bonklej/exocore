# $BONKLE Uniswap pool

A Uniswap pool will be established to allow for open-market $BONKLE trading. The initial liquidity will be brought in by the sale of <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/bonds">Bonkle Bonds</a>. LP rewards will be reinvested into the pool automatically.

## Fees
A transaction fee of 0.5% on all transfers of $BONKLE is returned to the <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/treasury">Treasury</a>. 

## FAILSAFE
If all Bonklers have been minted and the <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/reserve">Reserve</a> has burnt or auctioned all of its Bonklers, a timer will begin until the liquidity will be pulled and burned. This will prevent ether from being forever trapped in the <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/treasury">Treasury</a> and will provide a windfall for the final $BONKLE holders whose tokens' claims will be thereby made greater. This procedure aligns with $BONKLE's stated goal of being a temporary project. Were $BONKLE to remain in circulation indefinitely, the remaining holders in favor of this outcome would have to arrange for liquidity themselves.

## LP Providers (*optional*)
Token holders could stake their $BONKLE as LP. Swaps on Uniswap will likely incur an additional swap fee paid to liquidity providers. This could smooth out the transition from Treasury-loaned \$BONKLE facilitating liquidity to a future wherein the holders, in spite of the project's aims, seek to maintain a circulation of \$BONKLE.
