# To Do List for Bonkle (incomplete)
Considerations: how to manage the technical scope of project while maintaining Day 200 launch target?

- **Frontend:**
  - **entrance queue**
    - bid creator
      - ETH input
      - target price of \$BONKLE (eg 0.6 \$BONKLE per 1 ether)
    - display length of entrance queue in ether
    - bid chart sorted by target price
    - current Bidder bid for today's Bonkler
  - **bonkler reserve**
    - browsable collection of Bonklers
      - subhheading indicating: burn value of each bonkler, stats on auction (price, bid, link to day on Remilia frontend, etc.)
  - **bonkle treasury**
    - current ether value
      - breakdown earned source by:
        - fees
        - re-auction
        - auctioncore auction
        - loans
        - bids below
          - include average bid over time?
    - current \$BONKLE float (total \$BONKLE in circulation)
    - current floor price of \$BONKLE ((total burn value+treasury)/float)
  - **outside links**
    - dex pools
      - uniswap, etc.
    - bonkler.remilia.org
  - **bonkler re-auction**
    - basically copies remilia's frontend functionality but with our own artisitic flavor according to Bonkle aesthetic
