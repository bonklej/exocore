# History of Bonkle
The majority of the Bonkle design was completed over the course of a week in June 2023. Bonkle Jimmy brought the project to the MiyaMaker community after interactions with miya_g0d on Twitter. There, through interactions with the a few interested community members the project was refined (see <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/defunct">defunct components</a>). Bonkle J left the continent for the summer thereafter and the project was placed on hiatus. In mid August 2023 the project was resumed and this site published.
