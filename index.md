# *Bonkle*

Bonkle is a county fair in Remilia. Bonkle is a magnetic value capture mechanism. Bonkle is a year-long prank on a year-long prank. Bonkle is a daily challenge, Bonkle is a daily war. Bonkle is the token that runs only for a limited time, higher & higher, with you & me, together. Bonkle is a layer atop a Grand New Experimental Financial Adventure for the followers of the genius avant net art collective, Remilia Corporation. Propelled by the internationally renowned and beloved Milady Maker pfps, Bonkle is a bear hug on Bonkler, in financial alignment with the Remilia Corporation. Bonkle ushers on-chain financial artistry into brave new frontiers. Bonkle furthers the question of a finance art begun by Bonkler.

## The Bonkler Problem

[Bonkler NFT](bonkler.remilia.org) poses a unique challenge to traditional NFT price discovery mechanics. Fractionalization via minting fungible ERC-20 tokens - as emplyoed by [NFTx](nftx.io) - necessarily fails as the concept of a collection floor is incoherent to Bonkler - each NFT having a unique in-built reserve thus guaranteeing individualized floor price. 

This combined with the relative scarcity of Bonklers (a maximum of 400, but decreasing as burns occur) and their average high price, has denied exposure to the mass of retail investors usually attracted to mainstream Remilia projects. Bonkler has captured the hearts and minds of thousands, but only the wallets of a few.

*Bonkle* offers an on-ramp to the clamoring masses crying out for Bonkler by granting price exposure with room for speculation above a reserve-backed quasi-floor.

## Bonkle Opening

Bonkle is financial performance art through the medium of an ephemeral autonomous entity. The smart contracts which labor in Bonkle's onchain manifestation have a single collective will: maximize returns to shareholders. As the $BONKLE token is a redeemable share of the [[reserve]], the protocol is designed to maximize the flow of ether to this capital reservoir.

The tokens' backed value is contained in
1) the <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/reserve">Bonkle Reserve</a>, a vault containing all Bonklers acquired by way of auction or loan liquidation
2) the <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/treasury">Bonkle Treasury</a>, a receptacle for acquired ether

The Treasury has four primary revenue streams:
1) bids placed below the floor $BONKLE:ETH ratio of 0.7:1
2) transaction fees on $BONKLE
3) <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/re-auction">re-auctions</a> of Reserve Bonklers
4) <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/auctioncore-auction">auctioncore auctions</a>

$BONKLE issuance occurs when the <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/bidder">Bonkle Bidder</a> wins a Bonkler auction. $BONKLE is distributed to addresses who contributed ether to the <a class="wiki-link" href="/articles/entrance-queue">entrance queue</a> proportionate to their ether's fractional contribution in winning the day's Bonkler.
